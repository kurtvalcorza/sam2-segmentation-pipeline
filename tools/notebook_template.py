        "At inference the image is resized to 1024×1024 and encoded once by a Hiera image encoder; the prompt encoder "
        "embeds your clicks (label 1 = foreground, 0 = background) and/or one xyxy box, and the mask decoder returns up "
        "to three candidate masks at 256×256, which the pipeline up-samples to the input resolution and binarises at "
        "logit 0, together with the model's own predicted IoU for each candidate. **No adaptation occurs:** no training, "
        "fine-tuning, in-context conditioning, or preprocessing fitting happens in this notebook — the upstream "
        "checkpoint supplies the weights and processor, and the carried pipeline module adds snapshot verification, "
        "image and prompt validation with named ceilings, a single-object-per-call contract, a fixed output contract and "
        "the `mask_iou`, `validate_inputs` and `evaluation_report` helpers. The default sample is a synthetic scene "
        "drawn in code; the IoU reported for it is sanity evidence against a shape you drew, not a benchmark claim.\n\n"
        "**Expected load notice.** Transformers logs `You are using a model of type sam2_video to instantiate a model of "
        "type sam2` when Section 3 loads the model. It is expected and harmless: the pinned snapshot's `config.json` "
        "declares the video variant (`model_type: sam2_video`) while this pipeline loads the image-only `Sam2Model`, "
        "which shares the same weights (documented in the model card and README). A different warning, or an error, is a "
        "real signal."

        "immutable upstream model revision (and recognise the expected `sam2_video → sam2` load notice), draw a "

The pinned `torch==2.14.0` install and the ~184 MB checkpoint are the large downloads of the run.",

Optional BYOD upload is gated off by default so the sample path can run top-to-bottom without interaction. Expected BYOD input: one image file decodable by Pillow (PNG/JPEG/WebP and similar), any colour mode, sides between 16 and 4096 px, plus a click position inside it set through the form parameters.

        "The masks are the model's answer to *your* prompt: a click that is ambiguous returns candidates at several "
        "granularities, and the `iou_scores` used to rank them are the model's own uncalibrated estimates, not measured "
        "overlaps, and can exceed 1.0. On the synthetic scene the `mask_iou` values in the evaluation report compare "
        "candidates with a rectangle you drew yourself and the verdict is `sample-sanity`, which proves only that the input "
        "contract, prompt validation, forward pass and up-sampling work on a trivially separable shape; it says nothing about "
        "photographs, thin structures, transparent or occluded objects, or clicks near a boundary, and a BYOD result is a "
        "single-image observation with the verdict `not-measurable`. One object per call, image mode only, no text prompts, no "
        "class labels. The pipeline provides no video tracking, automatic segmentation, mIoU evaluation, or training "
        "capability.\n\n"
        "Successful execution proves that the recorded repository revision's pipeline module, carried in this notebook, can "
        "acquire and digest-verify the pinned model, validate the demonstrated request, execute the public pipeline path, and "
        "emit the shown machine-readable outputs in the tested runtime — without the repository being reachable. It does "
        "**not** establish benchmark superiority, deployment calibration, safety for high-consequence decisions, or production "
        "fitness on an unseen domain.\n\n"
        "**Next experiments:** set `MULTIMASK = False` and compare the single mask with the best candidate; prompt the disc "
        "with a box instead of a click (`pipe.segment(image, box=[200, 80, 281, 161], multimask=False)`) and compare its area "
        "with the disc's (about 5,026 px in the smoke run); add a background click (label 0) inside the rectangle after a "
        "foreground click on the disc to see the mask exclude it; enable `USE_BYOD` with a photograph, hand-draw one reference "
        "mask and pass it to `evaluation_report` to see the verdict switch to `sample-sanity` — the first step towards a real "
        "mIoU.\n\n"
