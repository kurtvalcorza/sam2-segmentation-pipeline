# Release verification

`tutorials/sam2_segmentation_colab.ipynb` (`TASK-INFERENCE`, **standalone** carrier) is a **release
candidate** until the exact notebook revision has executed top-to-bottom in a clean supported
runtime. Unit tests, JSON validation, code-cell compilation, the generator parity checks and
`tools/validate_release_assets.py` are necessary checks but are **not** runtime evidence under DIMER
Notebook Specification 1.1. This file is the durable release-gate record for the notebook.

## Automatic coverage (static, every pull request)

CI runs `tools/validate_release_assets.py`, which checks:

- notebook JSON parses; every code cell compiles as plain Python (no `%`/`!` magics); no
  persisted outputs or execution counts; no unresolved placeholder markers; every code cell
  is preceded by an explanatory markdown cell;
- exactly one tutorial notebook, named in `tutorials/README.md` with its `TASK-INFERENCE`
  profile, the notebook-spec version and the standalone carrier; `metadata.dimer` declares that
  profile, spec `1.1`, `standalone: true` and `generated_from` (repository, revision, module
  SHA-256, generator);
- the standalone carrier (ST1–ST6, PAR1–PAR3): no clone, repository install or repository import on
  the primary path; exactly one cell tagged `embedded_module` equal to
  `src/sam2_segmentation_pipeline/pipeline.py` after the generator's documented rewrites; the inline
  `MANIFEST` equal to the committed snapshot manifest and the inline `PINS` equal to the
  `pyproject.toml` runtime pins; the notebook byte-identical (on LF) to `tools/build_notebook.py`
  output for its recorded revision; the pinned-install cell with its restart-on-stale-import guard;
  `NOTEBOOK_SOURCE` recorded in exports;
- `MODEL_ID`/`MODEL_REVISION` are bound only in the carried module cell (and repeated in the inline
  manifest, which the notebook asserts against the module before fetching), the revision is a 40-hex
  immutable commit, and the same identity string appears in `README.md`, `MODEL_CARD.md`, and
  `docs/WEIGHTS.md` with no stray revisions;
- the profile-specific public-API calls (`stage_missing_files`, `verify_snapshot`,
  `SAM2SegmentationPipeline.from_pretrained(weights_dir=...)`, `validate_inputs`, `segment`,
  `evaluation_report`), the ceiling print (`MIN_IMAGE_SIDE`, `MAX_IMAGE_SIDE`, `MAX_PROMPTS`,
  `NUM_MULTIMASK_OUTPUTS`, `MASK_THRESHOLD`), the exports, the learner-facing statements
  (model-predicted uncalibrated `iou_scores` that may exceed 1.0, the argmax decision rule, no shipped
  threshold, no mIoU, IoU as sanity check, capability exclusions) and the gated-off BYOD default
  listed in the validator; forbidden patterns (credential-in-URL, any `git clone` / `github.com` /
  repository import on the primary path, a mutable `revision='main'`, direct `from transformers import`
  / `Sam2Model` / `Sam2Processor` / `post_process_masks(` / `from huggingface_hub import` use
  **outside the carried module cell**, `trust_remote_code=True`, `pickle.load`, `torch.load(`,
  `extractall(`);
- `STATUS.md`, `README.md` and `tutorials/README.md` agree on one release-status token and no
  document makes an unsupported release-grade, production-readiness or benchmark claim;
- `MODEL_CARD.md` front matter (`model_card_spec: "1.1"`), single H1, required heading order, and
  immutable provenance.

CI also installs the pinned CPU-only torch wheel plus `transformers`, `safetensors`, `numpy` and
`pillow`, runs `ruff check src tests tools`, `tools/build_notebook.py --check`, and the offline unit
suite (`tests/test_pipeline.py`, `tests/test_role_helpers.py`, `tests/test_notebook_parity.py`;
injected runner, no weights). These are source/provenance and unit checks. They are **not** execution
evidence.

## Executor paths

| Path | Runtime | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Google Colab (supported user path) | Colab CPU runtime (CUDA used automatically when present) | The runtime the tutorial is written for; a clean top-to-bottom run here is promotion evidence |
| Kaggle CLI kernel | Kaggle CPU kernel, Python 3.12 image | Reproducible clean-room executor of the same class; the notebook is pushed verbatim plus one leading shim cell that provides `google.colab` and chdirs to a scratch directory (**no repository checkout is needed — the notebook is standalone**) |
| Local Windows-venv harness (pre-flight only) | Workstation, sequential cell executor with a `google.colab` shim, `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1` | Builder pre-flight to catch defects before spending cloud runs; **not** a supported runtime and not promotion evidence |

## Supported release verification procedure

Before changing the registry status from `Candidate` to `Release-grade`:

1. resolve the exact PR/commit head under review and confirm static CI is green;
2. open that exact notebook revision in a new CPU (or CUDA) runtime (Colab, or the Kaggle
   executor above) with **no repository checkout** and a clean model cache;
3. run the notebook top-to-bottom without editing implementation cells (form parameters at their
   defaults for the sample path: `USE_BYOD = False`, `POINT_X = 90`, `POINT_Y = 120`,
   `MULTIMASK = True`);
4. verify that Section 1 reports `NOTEBOOK_SOURCE.repository_revision` equal to the revision recorded
   in `metadata.dimer.generated_from` and that the installed core package versions equal the inline
   `PINS` (= `pyproject.toml`);
5. verify every default-path stage completes:
   - pinned runtime installed from the inline `PINS` with no GitHub access;
   - the carried module cell executes (defines `SAM2SegmentationPipeline`, `validate_inputs`,
     `evaluation_report`, `mask_iou`, `validate_image`, `validate_prompts`, `verify_snapshot`,
     `stage_missing_files`) with no import of the repository package;
   - synthetic 320×240 scene drawn in code with its RGB SHA-256 printed, click `[[90, 120]]` label
     `[1]`, reference mask area 12,221 px, and the ceilings (`MIN_IMAGE_SIDE` 16, `MAX_IMAGE_SIDE`
     4096, `MAX_PROMPTS` 16, `NUM_MULTIMASK_OUTPUTS` 3, `MASK_THRESHOLD` 0.0) surfaced;
   - the load emits the documented `You are using a model of type sam2_video to instantiate a model of
     type sam2` notice and nothing else unexpected;
   - pinned `facebook/sam2.1-hiera-small` acquisition at the immutable revision through the carried
     module: the inline `MANIFEST` is asserted against the module identity and written to
     `weights/sam2.1-hiera-small/`, `stage_missing_files(WEIGHTS_DIR, allow_download=True)` reports all
     seven manifest entries on a clean runtime, `verify_snapshot` returns its summary dict, and
     `from_pretrained(weights_dir=WEIGHTS_DIR)` loads from the verified directory;
   - `validate_inputs` writes `outputs/sam2_segmentation_input_manifest.json` (verdict `accepted`,
     one click and no box, one recorded rejection finding from the click-outside-image probe);
   - `segment` returning `masks` of shape `(3, 240, 320)` bool and three `iou_scores`; record the
     scores and each candidate's area (the card-pass CPU smoke returned `[0.010, 0.993, 0.400]` with a
     best-mask area of 12,220 px; a materially different result is a finding to record, not a failure
     by itself, because no metric is asserted);
   - `evaluation_report` writes `outputs/sam2_segmentation_evaluation_report.json` with verdict
     `sample-sanity` and one `mask_iou` entry per candidate against the drawn rectangle (the smoke run
     measured 1.000 for the selected candidate); `not-measurable` on BYOD, stated as such;
   - `outputs/sam2_segmentation_result.json`, `outputs/sam2_segmentation_mask.png` and
     `outputs/sam2_segmentation_overlay.png` written with `NOTEBOOK_SOURCE`, model revision, model
     licence, runtime versions and device;
6. verify the exports exist and the interpretation section matches the observed path;
7. record the notebook Git blob id, commit, runtime (platform, Python, PyTorch, Transformers, device),
   model identifier and immutable revision, whether the model cache was clean, outcome, produced
   outputs, and any warning or applicable `SHOULD` deviation in the table below;
8. record no access tokens or other secrets.

A known-failing default path in the supported runtime blocks release.

## Recorded executions

Notebook identity is the Git blob id of `tutorials/sam2_segmentation_colab.ipynb` (verify with
`git rev-parse <commit>:tutorials/sam2_segmentation_colab.ipynb`). Wall times, when recorded,
are the sum of per-cell times reported by the executor and include installs and the model download;
they are measurements for the stated runtime, not general estimates.

### Manual clean-runtime evidence

| Date (UTC) | Commit / notebook blob | Executor | Path exercised | Wall | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | Default sample path | | pending — queued to the GPU lane |

## Current status

No clean-runtime execution of the notebook has been recorded yet; the run is **pending** and queued
to the GPU lane. Static validation (`tools/validate_release_assets.py`), nbformat validation, a
`compile()` sweep over every code cell, the generator parity checks (`--check` OK) and the offline
unit suite passed on the tutorial source at the candidate revision, which is necessary but not
sufficient. The registry status remains **Candidate** until a reviewer confirms a recorded run
against the notebook blob under review and an integrator promotes it; promotion is not performed by
the builder. Facts a reviewer should weigh: `stage_missing_files` was exercised only with an injected
downloader in the unit suite (the real `hf_hub_download` fetch into the snapshot directory has not
been executed); the card pass executed `segment` only on CPU in the Windows venv (returns/L2: CUDA
path not executed); and **the standalone carrier itself — executing the carried module cell in a
runtime that has no repository checkout — has been validated statically only (parity PASS) and never
run**, so the clean run will be the first execution of the standalone path and of the staging path.
